causing reproducibility issues for open-source and community firmware projects (such as Klipper).

Note:
The original download link included a hash parameter (?hash=E367D388F6429B67D5D6BECF691B9521), but this does not match the actual MD5 or SHA256 of the file. This is likely an internal identifier used by the hosting service, not a cryptographic checksum of the archive contents.
